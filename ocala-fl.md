## Visiting Ocala, Florida

- Horse capital of Florida
- You can go tubing on the river (that is where you float on a big donut on the river - aka lazy man's sport)
- The beach is about 1-1/2 hours away!
- My favorite place to eat is Luigis
- When I grew up there, "cruising the strip" was the thing to do on a Friday night!
